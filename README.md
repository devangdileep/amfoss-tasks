# Amfoss-tasks

## INTRODUCTION

My name is Devang Dileep, and I am a first-year BTech CSE student. I have beginner-level knowledge of Python and MySQL. I enjoy playing badminton, and I am passionate about coding, exploring new things, and problem-solving. I always like to put in consistent effort toward the things I enjoy and take pride in learning and improving myself along the way.

## Why should we choose you?

I believe in commitment, consistency, and discipline. During the Praveshan tasks, I tried my best to stay regular with updates and complete my work on time. I am eager to learn new technologies, and I enjoy exploring new ideas. I am confident I can be a good part of the club and am ready to put in the hard work.

## How do you intend to contribute back to the club?

I will actively participate in the discussions, activities, and events of the club. I am not someone who will quit after a month when the work gets harder. I am ready to put in the effort and time because I believe hard work always pays off. My passion for technology also motivates me to join competitions, and I will make sure to represent and promote AM@FOSS in the best way possible.

## What are your fields of interest, and how do you plan on working on them

My main field of interest is computers and coding. I enjoy working with Python, MySQL, app development, machine learning, and AI. I plan to work on these interests by building useful projects, practicing regularly, and exploring new technologies. Joining AM@FOSS will also give me opportunities to collaborate, learn from others, and apply my skills to real-world problems.

## What are your thoughts and feedback on the Praveshan Selection Process?

I think the Praveshan Selection Process is well-structured and gives a good opportunity to showcase dedication, consistency, and willingness to learn. During the tasks, I made sure to stay regular with updates and complete my work on time. The process encouraged me to stay disciplined, put in consistent effort, and improve my skills while adapting to new challenges. Overall, I found it to be a motivating and valuable experience.
